This is my solution to homework 2. I'm using Quarto render this document from a QMD file to a regular
MD file for display on GITHUB.

## Scenario

Imagine you're designing a Library Management System for a small local library. The system needs to track information about books and library members. Each book has a unique ISBN (International Standard Book Number), a title, and a publication year. Each library member is identified by a unique member ID, and the system needs to store their name and contact information. Library members can check out books, but they don’t have to.

## Design Task 1

Identify and document the entities, attributes, and relationships using Chen notation.

```{dot}
//| echo: false
graph ER {
    layout=neato;
  scale=1.1;
    node [shape=box]; building; room;
    node [shape=ellipse]; address, city, state, occupant, room_number
    node [shape=diamond,style=filled,color=lightgrey]; has
    
    building -- has [label="1",len=1.00]
    has -- room [label="n",len=1.00]
    
    building -- address
    building -- city
    building -- state
  room -- room_number
    room -- occupant
}
```

## Design Task 2

Identify and document the entities, attributes, and relationships using Crow’s Foot notation.

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: true
%%| eval: false
erDiagram
    ORDER }o--|| CUSTOMER : places
    ORDER }o--|| SALES_PERSON : places
    ORDER }o--|| PRODUCT : places
```
