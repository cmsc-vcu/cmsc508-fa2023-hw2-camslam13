This is my solution to homework 2. I'm using Quarto render this document from a QMD file to a regular
MD file for display on GITHUB.

## Scenario

Imagine you're designing a Library Management System for a small local library. The system needs to track information about books and library members. Each book has a unique ISBN (International Standard Book Number), a title, and a publication year. Each library member is identified by a unique member ID, and the system needs to store their name and contact information. Library members can check out books, but they don’t have to.

## Design Task 1

Identify and document the entities, attributes, and relationships using Chen notation.

```{dot}
//| echo: false
graph ER {
    layout=neato;
  scale=1.3;
    node [shape=box]; book; library_member;
    node [shape=ellipse]; name, contact_info, id, year, title, isbn
    node [shape=diamond,style=filled,color=lightgrey]; checks_out
    
    library_member -- has [label="1",len=1.00]
    has -- book [label="n",len=1.00]
    
    library_member -- id
    library_member -- name
    library_member -- contact_info
    book -- year
    book -- title
    book -- isbn
}
```

## Design Task 2

Identify and document the entities, attributes, and relationships using Crow’s Foot notation.

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: true
%%| eval: false
erDiagram
BUILDING ||--|{ ROOM : contains

BUILDING{
  string address
  string city
  string state
}

ROOM {
  string room_number
  string occupants
}
```
